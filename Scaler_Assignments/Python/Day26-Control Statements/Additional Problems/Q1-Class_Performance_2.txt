Q1. Class Performance 2

Problem Description

You have been given a dataset for marks of 2 subjects, scored by students of classes ClassA and ClassB. You now want to compare the performances of class A and class B by finding out the average performance of the classes. Write a program to find if class A performed better. Print True is Class A is strictly better else return False.


Input Format

There are 4 lines in the input.
The first and second lines are marks of subjects for Class A.
The third and fourth lines are marks of subjects for Class B.


Output Format

Print True if class A is strictly better else False.


Example Input

Input 1:-
80
27
54
61
Input 2:-
54
61
80
27

Example Output

Output 1:-
False
Output 2:-
True

Sample Exaplanation

Explanation 1:-
The average marks of class A is (80 + 27)/2 = 53.5, and the average of class B is (54 + 61)/2 = 57.5, so class B's average
is better hence False is printed.
Explanation 2:-
The average marks of class A is(54 + 61)/2 = 57.5, and the average of class B is(80 + 27)/2 = 53.5, so class B's average
is better hence True is printed.

Solution:

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
A_sub1 = int(input())
A_sub2 = int(input())
B_sub1 = int(input())
B_sub2 = int(input())

A_avg = (A_sub1 + A_sub2)/2
B_avg = (B_sub1 + B_sub2)/2

if A_avg > B_avg:
    print('True')
else:
    print('False')
