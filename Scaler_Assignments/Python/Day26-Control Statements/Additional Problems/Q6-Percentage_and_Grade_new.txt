If percentage >= 90% : Grade A
If percentage >= 80% but <90 : Grade B
If percentage >= 70% but <80: Grade C
If percentage >= 60% but <70: Grade D
If percentage >= 40% but <60: Grade E
If percentage < 40%: Grade F


NOTE: You have to take the lowest integer of the percentage. E.g. 90.8% will be treated as 90%.


Input Format

There will be five lines of inputs as following:
The five lines contain the 5 subject marks of the student in numerical format.


Output Format

The first line indicates the percentage in integer format.
The next line displays the grade in string format.


Example Input

60
70
80
90


Example Output

70
C

Solution:

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
marks1 = int(input())
marks2 = int(input())
marks3 = int(input())
marks4 = int(input())
marks5 = int(input())

percentage = (100 * (marks1 + marks2 + marks3 + marks4 + marks5))//500
print(percentage)

if percentage >= 90:
    print('A')
elif percentage >= 80 and percentage < 90:
    print('B')
elif percentage >= 70 and percentage < 80:
    print('C')
elif percentage >= 60 and percentage < 70:
    print('D')
elif percentage >= 40 and percentage < 60:
    print('E')
else:
    print('F')
