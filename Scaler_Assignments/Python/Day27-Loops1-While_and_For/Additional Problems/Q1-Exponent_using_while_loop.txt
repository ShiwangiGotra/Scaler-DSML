Q1. Exponent using while loop

Complete the following code snippet in order to find the exponent, i.e. the number of times base should be multiplied by itself to get num.

num=16
base=4
cnt=0
while(num>1):
  ?????
  cnt+=1
print(cnt)
Which of the options can be used in place of blank(?????) in order to get the power value?

An image to illustrate what exponent and base number mean:



Note - Assume that we can always get num by multiplying a base by 1 positive number of times.

i) num -= base

ii) num /= base

iii) num *= base

iv) num += base

Solution: ii
