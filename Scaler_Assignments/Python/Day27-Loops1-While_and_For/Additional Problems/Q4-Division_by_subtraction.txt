Q4. Division by subtraction

We want to find the Quotient(q), and Remainder(r) of the division of 2 numbers, i.e. x is divided by y.

Which of the following code blocks can be used for this? Assume that the code before blocks is common for all the blocks.

x = int(input())
y = int(input())

q = 0
r = 0

# Block A
while x > y:
    x -= y
    q += 1
print(q, r)

# Block B
while x >= y:
    x -= y
    q += 1
print(q, y)

# Block C
while x >= y:
    x -= y
    q += 1
print(q, x)

Solution: Block C
