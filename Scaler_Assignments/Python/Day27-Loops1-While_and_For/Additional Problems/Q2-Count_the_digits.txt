Q2. Count the digits

Problem Description
Take T (number of test cases) as input.
For each test case, take integer N as input and Print the count of digits of that number.

Note: No of digits for number 0 is considered as 1.

Problem Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
0 <= N <= 100000000

Input Format

The first line is the number T which denotes the total number of test cases.
Next T lines contain an integer N for which you have to print the number of digits.
Output Format

For T different Numbers, Print the number of digits in separate lines.
Example Input

Input 1: 
2
0
1

Input 2:
2
100
10101
Example Output

Output 1:
1
1
Output 2:
3
5
Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
0 and 1 both have only one digit.
Explanation 2:
100 has three digits and 10101 has 5 digits.

Solution:

T = int(input())
test = 1
while test <= T:
    N = int(input())
    if N == 0:
        count = 1
    else:
        count = 0
        while N:
            count += 1
            N //= 10
    print(count)
    test += 1
