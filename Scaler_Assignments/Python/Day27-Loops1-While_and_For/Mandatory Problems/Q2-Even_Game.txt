Q2. Even Game

Problem Description
Write a program to print all even numbers from 1 to N where you have to take N as input from the user.
Note: Use while-loop OR for-loop, according to session flow.

Note: You can use int(input()) for obtaining user input of number N.

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000000
Input Format

A single line representing N
Output Format

All even numbers from 1 to N are separated by spaces.
Example Input

Input 1:
5

Input 2:
10
Example Output

Output 1:
2 4 

Output 2:
2 4 6 8 10
Example Explanation

Sample 1:
2 4
The even numbers between 1 to 5 are 2 and 4. So the numbers 2 and 4 are printed separated by space.

Output 2:
2 4 6 8 10
The even numbers between 1 to 10 are 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. So the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are printed separated by space.

Solution:

def main():
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    # Please take input and print output to standard input/output (stdin/stdout)
    # E.g. 'input()/raw_input()' for input & 'print' for output
    N = int(input())
    i = 2
    while i <= N:
        if(i % 2 == 0):
            print(i,end=' ')
        i = i + 1

    return 0

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
