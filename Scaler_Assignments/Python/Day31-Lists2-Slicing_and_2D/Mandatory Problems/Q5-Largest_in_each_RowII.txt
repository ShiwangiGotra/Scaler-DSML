Q5. Largest in each Row II

Problem Description

Given a 2D array A of N rows and M columns. Find value of largest element in each row.
Note: The 2D array A is already passed as an argument to the function. User don't need to take any input. Just perform the task on the passed arguments and return the required result.

Problem Constraints

1 <= N, M <= 1000
1 <= Ai <= 109


Input Format

The first argument A is a 2D array of integers


Output Format

Return an array of length N, in which every index i contains the maximun value of the ith row in the 2D matrix.


Example Input

Input 1:
A = [[1, 2], [1, 3]]
Input 2:
A = [[1, 2, 3]]


Example Output

Output 1:
 [2, 3]
Output 2:
 [3]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
In the first row 2 is maximum value.
In the second row 3 is maximum value.
Explanation 2:
In the first and only row 3 is maximum value.

Solution:

def largest(A):
    result = []
    
    for row in A:
        max_value = row[0]  # Assume first element is the largest
        for num in row:
            if num > max_value:
                max_value = num  # Update max_value if a larger number is found
        result.append(max_value)  # Store the largest value of the row
    
    return result
