Q3. Inverse of the Array II

Problem Description

You are given an integer array A. Now your task is to find the inverse of A.
Now, the inverse of the array is A will be an array in which we change the
positions of the values as their indices and indices as values.

So, array A = [2, 0, 1]
- Now 2 is at index 0. So, place 0 at index 2.
- 0 is at index 1. So, place 1 at index 0.
- 1 is at index 2. So, place 2 at index 1.

So, the inverse of A will be [1, 2, 0]
Note: The integer array A is already passed as an argument to the function. User don't need to take any input. Just perform the task on the passed arguments and return the required result.


Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 105
0 <= A[i] < |A| (All elements are distinct)


Input Format

The first and the only argument is an array A.


Output Format

Return an array which is the inverse of the given array A.


Example Input

Input 1:
A = [2, 0, 1]
Input 2:
A = [3, 1, 0, 2]


Example Output

Output 1:
[1, 2, 0]
Output 2:
[2, 1, 3, 0]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
Index of 0 is 1, index of 1 is 2 and index of 2 is 0.
Explanation 2:
Index of 0 is 2, index of 1 is 1, index of 2 is 3 and index of 3 is 0.

Solution:

def invert(A):
    n = len(A)
    inverse = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        inverse[A[i]] = i    
    
    return inverse
