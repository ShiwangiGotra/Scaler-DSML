Q5. Two Line Star Pattern

Problem Description

Print a pattern consisting of N rows, where each row contains an asterisk (*) at the beginning and end of the line, with N-2 spaces in between.

The Pattern should look like:

*<N-2 Spaces>*

Print the above pattern for a total of N Rows.

Refer Example ouput, for better clarification.


Problem Constraints

2 <= N <= 100



Input Format

First and only line of input contains a single integer N.



Output Format

Output the pattern corresponding to the given N.



Example Input

Input 1:

 2
Input 2:

 4

Example Output

Output 1:

**
**
Output 2:

*  *
*  *
*  *
*  *


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
 Here N = 2,  So each row should have N - 2 spaces which is 0.
 Thus the N rows(i.e, 2 rows) should be in the form (asterisk)(0 spaces)(asterisk)
Explanation 2:
 Here N = 4,  So each row should have N - 2 spaces which is 2.
 Thus the N rows(i.e, 4 rows) should be in the form (asterisk)(2 spaces)(asterisk)

Solution:

# Taking input for the number of rows (N)
N = int(input())

# Loop through the range to control the number of rows
for i in range(N):
    print("*" + " " * (N - 2) + "*")
