Q4. HCF using Loop

Problem Description


Write a program to input an integer T which represents the number of test cases. For each test case input two integers A and B in two different lines. For each pair of A and B print the HCF of the given two numbers.



Problem Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000

1 <= A,B <= 1000000



Input Format


The first line of input contains T which means number of test cases.

Next 2T lines contains input A and B for each testcase.
First line of each testcase contain an integer A and second line of the testcase contains input B.

Output Format

T lines each containing an integer representing HCF of A & B.

Example Input

Input 1:
2
15
105 
24
36

Example Output

Output 1:
15
12

Solution:
T = int(input())

for i in range(1,T+1):
    A = int(input())
    B = int(input())
    if A < B:
        min = A
    else:
        min = B
    for j in range(1,min + 1):
        if A % j == 0 and B % j == 0:
            factor = j
    print(factor)
