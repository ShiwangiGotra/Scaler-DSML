Q2. Palindromic Integer

Problem Description

You are given an integer A as input and you need to determine whether it is a palindrome or not.
A palindrome integer is one whose digits, when reversed, result in the same number.
For example, 121 is a palindrome because its reverse is also 121, but 123 is not a palindrome because its reverse is 321.

Note: The given integer will not have any leading zeros.


Problem Constraints

1 <= A <= 106



Input Format

First and the only line contains a single integer A.



Output Format

Print Yes if it is palindromic, else print No.



Example Input

Input 1:

 120 
Input 2:

 1001 
Input 3:

 131 


Example Output

Output 1:

 No 
Output 2:

 Yes 
Output 3:

 Yes 


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 For A = 120, reverse(A) = reverse(120) = 021 = 21 (removing leading zeroes). 120 is not equal to 21 
Explanation 2:

 For A = 1001, reverse(A) = reverse(1001) = 1001, which is same as A.
Explanation 3:

 For A = 131, reverse(A) = reverse(131) = 131, which is same as A. 

Solution:

num = int(input())
original_num = num
rev_num = 0
num_str = str(num)
for i in range(len(num_str)):
    digit = num % 10
    rev_num = rev_num * 10 + digit
    num = num // 10
    
if original_num == rev_num:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
