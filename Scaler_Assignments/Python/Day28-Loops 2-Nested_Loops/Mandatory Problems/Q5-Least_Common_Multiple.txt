Q5. Least Common Multiple

Problem Description

Write a program to input an integer T and then for each test case input two integers A and B in two different lines and then print T lines containing Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two given 2 numbers A and B.

Note: LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer divisible by both.


Problem Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000

1 <= A,B <= 1000




Input Format

The first line contains T which means number of test cases.

Next 2T lines contains input A and B for each testcase.
First line of each testcase contain an integer A and second line of the testcase contains input B.




Output Format



T lines each containing an integer representing LCM of A & B.




Example Input

Input 1:
3
2
3
9
6
2
6


Example Output

Output 1:
6
18
6


Example Explanation

Explanation:

 In first testcase 6 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 2 (2 * 3 = 6) and 3 (3 * 2 = 6).
 In second testcase 18 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 9 (9 * 2 = 18) and 6 (6 * 3 = 18).
 In third testcase  6 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 2 (2 * 3 = 6) and 6 (6 * 1 = 6).

Solution:

T = int(input())

for i in range(1,T+1):
    A = int(input())
    B = int(input())
    if A < B:
        min = A
    else:
        min = B
    for j in range(1,min + 1):
        if A % j ==0 and B % j == 0:
          factor = j
    LCM = int((A * B)/factor)
    print(LCM)
