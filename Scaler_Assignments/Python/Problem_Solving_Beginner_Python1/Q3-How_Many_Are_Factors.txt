Q3. How Many Are Factors

Given an array A and an integer B, find the number of values in A which fully divide B.

Return the count of such numbers in A.

Sample Input-

A = [1,2,5,6,4,3]
B = 560
Sample Output-

4
Explanation-

The values 1,2,5 and 4 divide 560 fully. So 4 is returned.

Solution:

def divides(A, B):
    # Your Code Goes Here
    count = 0
    for i in A:
        if B % i == 0:
            count += 1
    
    return count
