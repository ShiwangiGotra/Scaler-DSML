Q4. Intersection of Multiple Arrays

You are given multiple arrays. Write the code to find their intersection.

The arrays are stored in a list all_arrays. Return the answer in the form of a set.


Sample Input-

all_arrays = [[1,2, 4, 6], [2, 4, 7, 8], [9, 6, 4, 2]]
Sample Output-

{2, 4}
Sample Explanation-

2 and 4 are present in all the arrays. So a set containing 2 and 4 is returned.

Solution:

def findIntersection(all_arrays):
    # Your Code Goes Here
    a =set(all_arrays[0])
    for i in all_arrays[1:]:
        a = a.intersection(set(i))
    return a
