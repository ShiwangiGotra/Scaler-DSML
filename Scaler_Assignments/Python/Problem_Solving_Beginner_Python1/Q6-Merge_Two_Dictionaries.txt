Q6. Merge Two Dictionaries

You are given two dictionaries A and B. Write the code to merge the dictionaries. In case they have common keys, the larger value should be chosen.

Return the merged dictionary.

Hint - .get(key, value) method of dictionary returns value if key doesn't exist in dictionary.

For example - .get(key, -105) will give -105 if the key doesn't exist in the dictionary.

Look at the constraints given below to choose the right 'value' in .get() if required.

Constraints-

-105 < A[key] < 105

-105 < B[key] < 105

Sample Input-

A = {'t1' : 5, 't2' : 10, 't3' : 15}
B = {'t3' : 12, 't4' : 20}
Sample Output-

{'t2': 10, 't1': 5, 't4': 20, 't3': 15}

Solution:

def merge(A, B):
    # Your Code Goes Here
    C = {}
    for key in A:
        C[key] = A[key]

    for key in B:
        if key in C:
            C[key] = max(C[key],B[key])
        else:
            C[key] = B[key]

    return C
