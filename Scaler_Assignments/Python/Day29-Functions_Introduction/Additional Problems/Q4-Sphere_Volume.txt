Q4. Sphere Volume

Problem Description:

You are given a positive integer r denoting the radius of a sphere as a parameter. Write a program to calculate the volume of the sphere. The volume of a sphere having radius R is given by (4 * Ï€ * R3) / 3.

NOTE: Return the volume of the sphere up to two decimal places. You can use round().

NOTE2: Use pi as 22/7 (not math.pi).

Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of the test cases. For each testcase there will be one line of input:
The one line contains r in integer format.
Output Format:

The volume of the sphere in float format is printed for each testcase in a new line.
Sample Input:

1
8
Sample Output:

2145.52

Solution:

def volume_sphere(r):
    '''input: r = Input in integer format
       output:return Vol of sphere upto two decimals'''
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    Vol = round((4 * (22/7) * r * r * r)/3,2)   
    
    return Vol
