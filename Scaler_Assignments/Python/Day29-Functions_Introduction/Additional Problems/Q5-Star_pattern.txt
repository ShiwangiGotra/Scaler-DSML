Q5. Star pattern

Problem Description:

Write a function to print a pattern similar to the one shown in the sample using n which is given to you as an argument to a function. Here n defines the number of rows.

Note: There are no spaces between the stars in the first row, and there are no spaces at the end of each row.

Input Format:

The only argument to the function in an integer n.
Output Format:

Print Star Pattern in string format for each testcase.
Sample Input:

8
Sample Output:

********
*     *
*    *
*   *
*  *

Sample Explanation:

In the first row, (n=8) stars are printed. 
In the second row, 2 stars are printed with 5 spaces between them. 
This number of spaces keeps decreasing by 1 after the second row until the last row where the number of spaces becomes zero and only one star is printed.

Solution:

def star(n):
    for i in range(n,0,-1):
        for j in range(1,i+1):
            if j==1 or j == i or i==n:
                print('*',end='')
            else:
              print(' ',end='')
        print()
