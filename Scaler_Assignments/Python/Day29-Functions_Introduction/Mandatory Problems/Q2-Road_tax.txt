Note1: Return the tax up to one decimal place. You can use round(tax,1)

Note2: You need not take input in this problem, you need to only implement the function provided.

Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of test cases. For each testcase there will be a single line of input representing the cost price.
Output Format:

Return tax in float format.
Sample Input 1:

1
25000
Sample Output 2:

1250.0
Sample Explanation 1

The given cost price of vehicle is 25000 which is less than 50,000. 
Hence the tax applicable is 5%. So if we calculate 5% of 25,000, it evaluates to 1250.0.
Sample Input 2:

1
60000
Sample Output 2:

6000.0
Sample Explanation 2

The given cost price of vehicle is 60,000 which is greater than 50,000 but less than 75,000. 
Hence the tax applicable is 10%. So if we calculate 10% of 60,000, it evaluates to 6000.0.

Solution:

def road_tax(price):
    tax = None
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    if price <= 50000:
        tax = (5 * price)/100
    elif price > 50000 and price <= 75000:
        tax = (10 * price)/100
    elif price > 75000 and price <= 100000:
        tax = (15 * price)/100
    else:
        tax = (20 * price)/100
    return tax
