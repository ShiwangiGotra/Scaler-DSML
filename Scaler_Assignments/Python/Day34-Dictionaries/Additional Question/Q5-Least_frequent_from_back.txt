Output Sample

j

Solution:

def count_char(st):
    if not st:
        return None  # Handle empty string case

    # Step 1: Count character frequencies manually
    char_count = {}
    for char in st:
        char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1

    # Step 2: Find the minimum frequency
    min_freq = min(char_count.values())

    # Step 3: Iterate from the end to find the last character with min frequency
    for char in reversed(st):
        if char_count[char] == min_freq:
            return char

    return None  # If no character meets the criteria (edge case)
