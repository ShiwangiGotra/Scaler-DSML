Problem Description

Write a program to print the input array A of size N in reverse order where you have to take integer N and further N elements as input from user.


Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= A <= 1000
Input Format

The first line of the input is the size of the array N. 
The next N lines of the input is integer of the array.

Output Format

A single line containing N space separated integers representing elements of the input array in reverse order.
Note - Keep a space character (' ') at the end of the line.

Example Input

Input 1:

5 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5

Output 1:

5 4 3 2 1 
Output 2:

80 40 50 10 

Solution:

#Your Code Goes Here
def rev_lst():
    N = int(input())
    A = list()
    for i in range(N):
        elem = int(input())
        A.append(elem)
    
    for i in range(-1,-(len(A)+1),-1):
           print(A[i],end=' ')

rev_lst()
