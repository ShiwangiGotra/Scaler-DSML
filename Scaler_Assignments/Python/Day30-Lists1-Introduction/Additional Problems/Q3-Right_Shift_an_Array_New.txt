Q3. Right Shift an Array New

Problem Description

Write a program that reads an integer array A from input and modifies the array by shifting each element to the right by one position and by shifting the last element to the first position. Return the modified array.

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
Input Format

The first line of the input is the size of the array N.
The next N lines of the input is integer of the array.
Example Input

5
1 
2 
3 
4 
5
Example Output

[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation

The elements 1, 2, 3 and 4 have been shifted to the right by one position and 5 has been moved to the first position.

Solution:

# def shift():
#     N = int(input())  # Number of elements
#     A = list()  
#     for i in range(N):
#         elem = int(input())
#         A.append(elem)
    
#     if A:
#         last = A.pop()
#         A.insert(0,last)

#     return A


def shift():
  ls = list()
  N = int(input())
  for i in range(N):
    elem = int(input())
    ls.append(elem)

  if ls:
    last_elem = ls.pop()    
    new_ls = [last_elem] + ls
  return new_ls
