Q6. Divisible by 5 and 7

Problem Description

Write a program that returns the list of elements that are present in the given list and are divisible by 5 and 7.


Problem Constraints

1 <= A.size() <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 105


Input Format

The only argument is an Integer Array A.


Output Format

Return an Integer Array, denoting the elements that are divisible by 5 and 7 from the given list.


Example Input

Input 1:
A = [5, 7, 70, 50, 35]
Input 2:
A = [105, 57]


Example Output

Output 1:
[70, 35]
Output 2:
[105]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
Only 35 and 70 are divisible by 5 and 7 from the list [5, 7, 70, 50, 35]

Therefore the list consisting of only these two elements is returned.
Explanation 2:
105 is divisible by (5 and 7).

Solution:

def divisible(A):
    ls = list()
    for i in A:
        if i % 5 ==0 and i % 7 == 0:
            ls.append(i)
    return ls
