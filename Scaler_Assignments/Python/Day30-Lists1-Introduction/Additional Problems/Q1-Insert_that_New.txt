Q1. Insert that New

Problem Description

Write a program to input N numbers array, a number X and a number Y from user and insert an element Y in it at specified position X. X is based on 1-based indexing

Note: When an element is inserted at position X, all elements that were already present at position >= X, gets shifted to one position right, not replaced.

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 100

1 <= A[i] <= 1000

1 <= X <= N

1 <= Y <= 1000

Input Format

First line is N which represents number of elements.

The next N lines contains an integer.

Third line is X position where Y has to be inserted.

Fourth line is Y which is the value to be inserted.

Output Format

N+1 space separated integers of the input array after inserting the element at required position.

Example Input

Input 1:

5

2

3

1

4

2

3

5

Example Output

Output 1:

2 3 5 1 4 2

Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

Clearly after inserting 5 at 3rd position, new array is 2 3 5 1 4 2.

Solution:

# Your Code Goes Here
def insert_at_pos():
    N = int(input())  #length of list
    A = list()  # define an empty list
    for i in range(N):
        elem = int(input())
        A.append(elem) # enter elements in list
    X = int(input()) #enter position at which elements to be inserted
    Y = int(input()) # enter the element to be inserted

    A.insert(X-1,Y)  # inserts the element at x position

    for i in A:
        print(i,end=' ') # print the list

insert_at_pos()
