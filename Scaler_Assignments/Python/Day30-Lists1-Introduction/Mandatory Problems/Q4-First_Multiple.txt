Q4. First Multiple

Problem Description

Write a program for a given integer x and a list ls to return the first multiple of x that occurs in the list,
and if there isnâ€™t any multiple of x in the list then return -1.

Note: The list with elements and the integer x is already passed as an argument to the function. User don't need to take any input. Just perform the task on the passed arguments and return the required result.

Problem Constraints

1 <= len(ls) <= 103
1 <= ls[i] <= 105
1 <= x <= 105


Input Format

First line of input is number of test cases t.
The remaining lines contain the test cases.
For each test case-
First line of input is the integer x.
Second line of input contains the elements of ls, separated by spaces.


Output Format

Return the first multiple of x from the list in integer format, else return -1.


Example Input

Input 1:
ls = [2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
x  = 4
Input 2:
ls = [7, 5, 3, 17]
x  = 2


Example Output

Output 1:
4
Output 2:
-1


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
In the list, the first element that is a multiple of 4 is 4.
Explanation 2:
There is no multiple of 2, So return -1

Solution:

def first_multiple(ls,x):
    for num in ls:
        if num % x == 0:
            return num
    return -1
