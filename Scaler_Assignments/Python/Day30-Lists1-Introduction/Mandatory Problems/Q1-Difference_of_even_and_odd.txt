Q1. Difference of even and odd

Problem Description

Write a program to find the difference between the sum of all even elements and the sum of all odd elements from the given array, A.
Note: The array of elements will be passed as an argument to the function. You don't need to take any input of array.

Problem Constraints

1 <= len(A) <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 105


Input Format

The only argument is the array of integers, A.


Output Format

The difference of the even and odd elements sum in integer format.

Solution:

def even_odd(A):
    diff = 0
    sum_even = 0
    sum_odd = 0
    for i in A:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum_even += i
        else:
            sum_odd += i
    diff = abs(sum_even - sum_odd)

    
    return diff
