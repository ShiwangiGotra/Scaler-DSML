Q2. Sum the Array

Problem Description

Write a program to print sum of elements of the input array A of size N.

Note: User is supposed to write a program from scratch to add the elements of the input array and print the result.


Problem Constraints


1 <= N <= 1000

1 <= A <= 1000




Input Format

- The first integer N denotes the number of integers in the array.
- The next N integers denotes the element of the array A.



Output Format

A single integer containing sum of elements from the input array.




Example Input


Input 1:


5 1 2 3 4 5
Input 2:

4 10 50 40 80



Example Output

Output 1:

15
Output 2:

180

Example Explanation

Input-1:
N = 5 , A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
here the first integer is the size of A and the remaining elements are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
which all sum to 15 
Input-2:
N = 4 , A = [10, 50, 40, 80]
here the first integer is the size of A and the remaining elements are [10, 50, 40, 80]
which all sum to 180

Solution:

def calculate_sum(input_list):
   total_sum = 0
   for i in input_list:
    total_sum = total_sum + i
   return total_sum
