Problem Description:

Given two sentences, write a program to return the sum of the total number of unique words from each sentence.

Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of test cases. There will be two lines of inputs for each test cases as following:
The two lines consist of two sentences in string format.
Output Format:

The number of unique words from the sentences in integer format.
Sample Input:

1
in data analysis we use data and process it further to create better interpreted data
more and more data will be passively collected
Sample Output:

20
Sample explanation:

{'use', 'process', 'create', 'better', 'analysis', 'in', 'it', 'further', 'and', 'we', 'data', 'interpreted', 'to'} 
represent the 13 unique words from sentence1 and {'collected', 'more', 'be', 'and', 'data', 'passively', 'will'} 
represent the 7 unique words from sentence2. Therefore 13 + 7 = 20 is returned.
Note:

If a word is present in both sentences it should be counted separately for both sentences.

Solution:

def set_operation(sent1,sent2):
    ''' input:sent1,sent2-two sentences taken as inputs
         output:return the sum of length of unique words.'''
    
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    a = len(set(sent1.split()))
    b = len(set(sent2.split()))
    return a + b
