Q2. Adding to a tuple

Predict the output of the following code as we are trying to append to an immutable tuple:

name_lst = ["Vijay", "Vickey"]
tup = ("Item_1", 0.5, name_lst)
name_lst.append("Vishal")
print(tup)

A- (“Item1”, 0.5, namelst)
B- (“Item_1”, 0.5, [“Vijay”, “Vickey”])
C- (“Item_1”, 0.5, [“Vijay”, “Vickey”, “Vishal”])
D- Error

Answer: D- Error

Tuple is immutable so we can not make any changes in it.
