Problem Description

Write a program that returns the symmetric difference of two sets, without actually using the symmetric difference operator.
Input Format

The first line indicates the number of test cases. There will be two lines of inputs for each testcase as following:
The two lines consist of space-separated integers representing the elements of set1 then set2
Output Format

Return the required set.
Example Input

1
10 20 30 40
30 40 50 60
Example Output

{10, 20, 50 ,60}
Example Explanation

{10 20 30 40} - {30 40 50 60} = {10, 20, 50 ,60}

Solution:

def symm_diff(set1, set2 ):
    ''' input:set1,set2-two sets
        output:return symmetric difference set
    '''
    
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    return ((set1.union(set2))-(set1.intersection(set2)))
