Problem Description:

Write a function to print out the frequency of all the unique elements present in a given tuple.

Q4. Frequency of unique elements

Input Format:

The one input line consists of a tuple.
Output Format:

Unique elements and their frequencies are expected to be printed as follows:  
unique_element1 : freq1  
unique_element2 : freq2  
.  
.
Sample Input 1:

(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)
Sample Output 1:

10 : 3
8 : 4
5 : 2
2 : 2
15 : 1  
Sample Input 2:

(100, -10, -10, “ONE”, [22], [22], “ONE”)
Sample Output 2:

100 : 1
-10 : 2
ONE : 2
[22] : 2

Solution:

def unique_count(tup):
    ''' input:tup-indicates the tuple
         output:Print the unique elements and their frequency'''
    
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    # sets = set(tup)

    counted = []
    for i in range(len(tup)):
        if tup[i] not in counted:
            count = 0
            for j in range(len(tup)):
                if tup[i] == tup[j]:
                    count += 1
            print(f'{tup[i]} : {count}')
            counted.append(tup[i])
