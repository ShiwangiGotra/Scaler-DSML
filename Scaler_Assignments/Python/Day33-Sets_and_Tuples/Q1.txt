Q1. 

Problem Description:

Write a program to divide a given tuple into two tuples that contain even and odd indexed elements of the original tuple. Print both these tuples in the given output format.

Note: The input tuple follows 1-based indexing. This means the element at index 0 is treated as having index as 1.

For example, (9,2,3). The 1-based index of 2 is 2.

Input Format:

The input contains a tuple as an argument to the function.
Output Format:

Print two tuples one for odd indexed elements and another for even indexed elements in the following format:
Odd: (....)
Even: (....)
Sample Input:

1
(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)

Sample Output:

Odd: (10, 5, 10, 10, 5, 8)
Even: (8, 2, 15, 8, 8, 2)

Solution:

def odd_even_split_tuple(tup):    

    # method1

    # print('Odd:',tup[0::2])
    # print('Even:',tup[1::2]) 

    # method2
    odd_ls = []
    even_ls = []
    for i in range(len(tup)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            odd_ls.append(tup[i])
        else:
            even_ls.append(tup[i])

    t1 = tuple(odd_ls)
    t2 = tuple(even_ls)
    print(f'Odd: {t1}')
    print(f'Even: {t2}')
