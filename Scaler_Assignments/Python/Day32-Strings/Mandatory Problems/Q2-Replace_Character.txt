Q2. Replace Character

Problem Description

You are given a character string A and two integer ASCII codes B and C.

You have to find and replace all the occurrences of the character having ASCII code equal to B with character having ASCII code equal to C and return the resultant string.

                                                image


Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105

A[i] âˆˆ ['a'-'z']

97 <= B, C <= 122



Input Format

First argument is a character string A.

Second argument is an integer B.

Third argument is an integer C.



Output Format

Return the resultant string after replacing the character(s).



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = "aabbccbb"
 B = 98 
 C = 100
Input 2:

 A = "abc"
 B = 100
 C = 97


Example Output

Output 1:

 aaddccdd 
Output 2:

 abc 


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Character having ASCII code equal to 98 = 'b' 
 Character having ASCII code equal to 100 = 'd'
 Character 'b' occurs at positions 3, 4, 7 and 8 in "aabbaabb".
 After replacing the characters, string becomes "aaddaadd".
Explanation 2:

 Character having ASCII code equal to 100 = 'd'
 Character 'd' is not present in "abc".
 The resultant string is same as string A.


Expected Output
Provide sample input and click run to see the correct output for the provided input. Use this to improve your problem understanding and test edge cases
Arg 1: A single String, For e.g 'anagram'
Enter Input Here
Arg 2: A single Integer, For e.g 9
Enter Input Here
Arg 3: A single Integer, For e.g 9
Enter Input Here

Solution:

class Solution:
    # @param A : string
    # @param B : integer
    # @param C : integer
    # @return a strings
    def solve(self, A, B, C):
        old_char = chr(B)  
        new_char = chr(C) 

        return A.replace(old_char, new_char)
