Q4. Map, reduce and filter

Problem Description

In this exercise, complete the function func, which takes integers, names, and numbers as the parameters.

a. Use map() to return the list of the squares of each number.

b. Use filter() to return the list with only those names that have less than or equal to seven letters.

c. Use reduce() to return the product of elements of list numbers.


Input Format

Space separated values for integers
Space separated values for names (string)
Space separated values for numbers


Output Format

List of the squares of each number
List with only those names that have less than or equal to seven letters.
The product of elements of list numbers.


Example Input

4 6 3 9 2 8 12
scaler interviewbit rishabh student course
4 6 9 23 5


Example Output

[16, 36, 9, 81, 4, 64, 144]
['scaler', 'rishabh', 'student', 'course']
24840


Example Explanation

From the first list (integers), every number is squared and the resultant list [16, 36, 9, 81, 4, 64, 144] is returned. From the second list (names), only words with less than or equal to 7 characters are selected and added to the second resultant list, and ['scaler', 'rishabh', 'student', 'course'] is returned. From the last list (numbers), the product of all the numbers (24840) is returned.

Solution:

from functools import reduce 
def func(integers, names, numbers):
    '''
    input:
    integers -> list of integers to perform the square operation on
    names -> list of names to filter out as per the condition
    numbers -> list of numbers whose product we want
    
    output:
    map_result -> output of integers list
    filter_result -> output of the names lsit
    reduce_result -> output of the numbers list
    '''
    map_result, filter_result, reduce_result = None, None, None
    
    # Your code stars here
    map_result = list(map(lambda x: x**2,integers))
    filter_result = list(filter(lambda x :len(x) <= 7,names))
    reduce_result = reduce(lambda a,b:a * b,numbers)
    
    # Your code ends here
    
    return map_result, filter_result, reduce_result
