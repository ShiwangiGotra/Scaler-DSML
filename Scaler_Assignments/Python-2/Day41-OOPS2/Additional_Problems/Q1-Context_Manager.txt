Q1. Context Manager

Examine the following code involving a context manager:

class ManagedFile:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename

    def __enter__(self):
        self.file = open(self.filename, 'w')
        return self.file

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()

with ManagedFile('test.txt') as f:
    f.write('Hello, World!')
    raise ValueError("An error occurred")
What happens when this code is executed?

i) The file test.txt is written with "Hello, World!" and remains open.

ii) The file test.txt is written with "Hello, World!" and is properly closed despite the raised exception.

iii) The file test.txt is not created because an exception is raised.

iv) A ValueError is raised, and the file remains open.

Solution: ii
