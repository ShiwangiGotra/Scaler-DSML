Q5. filtering and sorting integers

Problem Description
Write a Python function that takes a single string consisting of numbers separated by spaces. The function should:

Split the string into a list of numbers.
Convert each number into an integer.
Use the filter function along with a lambda to remove all numbers that are below a certain threshold (remove numbers less than zero).
Use the sorted function with a lambda as the key to sort the remaining numbers in ascending order.
Return (or print) the final list of numbers.
Input Format
A single line of input, which is a string containing integers separated by spaces.
For example:

"10 -5 3 0 15 -2 7"
Output Format
A list of integers that meet the threshold requirement, sorted in ascending order.
For example:

[0, 3, 7, 10, 15]

Solution:

def filter_and_sort_numbers(numbers_string):
    """
    This function takes a string of numbers separated by spaces, 
    converts them to integers, filters out negative numbers, 
    and returns the sorted list of remaining numbers.
    """
    # 1. Split the string into a list of numeric strings
    str_lst = numbers_string.split()
    new_ls = []
    
    # 2. Convert each string to an integer
    for i in str_lst:
        new_ls.append(int(i))   
    pos_lst = [] 
        
    # 3. Filter out negative numbers
    for i in new_ls:
        if i >= 0:
            pos_lst.append(i)
    
    
    # 4. Sort the numbers in ascending order
    pos_lst.sort()
    
    # 5. Return the final list
    return pos_lst
