Q5. Complexity of loops

What is the Big O space complexity of the following piece of code in the terms of n (size of arr)?

def function(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    hash = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            hash[i][j] = arr[i]*2
    return sum([sum(i) for i in hash])

function([1,2,3,4,5])

i) n

ii) n^3

iii) n^2

iv) log(n)

Solution: iii
