Q2. Props Inheritance

You are given a small code snippet from a game, BrickBreaker. The props.py is containing a class Props which has all the basic features common in every prop. You are also given a ball.py file containing the properties a ball should have in order to play the game.

Props.py

class Props:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
Ball.py

class Ball(Props):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        super().__init__(x, y)
        self.shape = "o"
        self.number = 1
        self.vely = 0
        self.velx = 0

    def get_x(self):
        return self.x
 
    def get_y(self):
       return self.y

    def get_velx(self):
       return self.velx
 
    def get_vely(self):
       return self.vely
    
    def inc_velx(self):
       self.velx = self.velx+2
    
    def inc_vely(self):
       self.vely = self.vely+1

You need to find the output of the following code considering the given 2 files.

obj_ball = Ball(27,3)

bx = obj_ball.get_x()
by = obj_ball.get_y()
b_velx = obj_ball.get_velx()
b_vely = obj_ball.get_vely()

print(bx, by, b_velx, b_vely)
Here,

x and y are the coordinates of the prop
shape is the character with which the ball is represented by
number is the number of balls in the game
velx is the velocity in x direction.
vely is the velocity in y direction.

Solution:

i) 27 3 0 0

ii) Error: x and y are not defined

iii) 27 3 2 1

iv) 0 0 0 0

Solution: i
