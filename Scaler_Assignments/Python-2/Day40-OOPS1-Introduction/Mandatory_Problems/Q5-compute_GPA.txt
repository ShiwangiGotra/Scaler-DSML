Q5. compute GPA

Problem Description
Create a class Student and initialize it with the following class variables:


marks in subject 1
credit of subject 1
marks in subject 2
credit of subject 2

Create a function gradepointaverage() for the Student class which computes the GPA rounded to two decimals, based on the following criteria of points in a subject :

1. If marks>=90:10 points
2. If 90>marks>=75: 9 points
3. If 75>marks>=60: 8 points
4. If 60>marks>=45: 7 points
5. If marks<45: 0 points



GPA =  
creditofsubject1+creditofsubject2
(pointsinsubject1∗creditofsubject1+pointsinsubject2∗creditofsubject2)
​
 

The points in a subject should be calculated according to the criteria mentioned in the question.
Also, implement a special zero case to handle when credits of both subjects are 0, return "-1.0".

Input Format

Class Student takes input in the form (marks1,marks2,credits1,credits2)


Output Format

GPA value


Example Input

(85, 76, 3, 4)


Example Output

9.0



Note: The Math.round() method in Java is used to round a floating-point or double-precision number to the nearest integer value. It performs standard rounding, where values with a fractional part less than 0.5 are rounded down, and values with a fractional part greater than or equal to 0.5 are rounded up.

Math.round(65.752) -> 66
Math.round(65.467) -> 65

Can you use this to return the output in required format from the gradepointaverage() function?

Solution:

class Student():
    
    def __init__(self, marks1,marks2,credits1, credits2):
        #YOUR CODE GOES HERE
        self.marks1 = marks1
        self.marks2 = marks2
        self.credits1 = credits1
        self.credits2 = credits2 
    
    def credits(self,marks):
        if marks >= 90:
            return 10
        elif 90 > marks >= 75:
            return 9
        elif 75 > marks >= 60:
            return 8
        elif 60 < marks >= 45:
            return 7
        else:
            return 0
    
    def grade_point_average(self):
        gpa=0
        
        #YOUR CODE GOES HERE
        if self.credits1 != 0 and self.credits2 != 0:
            gpa = ((self.credits1 * self.credits(self.marks1)) + (self.credits2 * self.credits(self.marks2)))/(self.credits1 + self.credits2)
    
            return round(gpa,2)
        else:
            return -1.0
